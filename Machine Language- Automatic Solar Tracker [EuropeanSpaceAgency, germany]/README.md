# Arduino-Solar-Tracker
Automated single or dual axis Photo-Voltaic(PV) panel array rotation to achieve maximum surface area exposure to sunlight with automatic nightly orientation reset.  This will optimize solar power generation with 40%-60% improvement in efficiency over fixed PV panel installations.
